# Intelligent Discussion Board - CS Project
## Description
__This is a school project.__ Intelligent Discussion Board, a.k.a IDB, is a group CS Project.
The objective of the project is to develop an IDB using Python and Natrual Language processing skills that is able to respond to a wide range of queries. 
More information about the project is found below  in the "Background" section. 

## Project Background
Students use discussion board on elearning to their post queries. 
The queries can be answered by the instructor, TA, or other students.
Most often the queries are repetitive or trivial. 
Many students donâ€™t follow the discussions, so they do not know that the query has already been answered. 
Many do not read the syllabus, project specs properly and post queries for which answers can easily be found in those documents. 
The purpose of IDB is remove the burden of answering these types of queries from the instructor. 
For any such types trivial queries, IDB should automatically post a response.
IDB will be developed in Python and deployed on a server. 
The UI could bean app or web-based. 
If time permits, IDN should be linked to elearning.
The project should use NLP tool kits extensively to give a human like interaction with students. 
IDB chatbot should be trained for a particular course like Systems Programming in UNIX. 
IDB should have very low error rate as we do not want to provide incorrect replies.
